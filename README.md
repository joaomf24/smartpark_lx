# smartpark_lx

Hello friends!

This is the source code of my thesis project "SmartPark Lx".
You can find the Ionic 3 project which has the 'angular2-google-maps' and 'angularfire2' APIs to connect with Google Maps and Firebase. This app is NOT final or in production but it was developed to be part of a Smart Parking prototype along with a network containg parking sensors and gateways. The source code of the sensors and gateway are also in this project. The sensors are based in Arduino and the gateways are Raspberry Pis with Raspbian OS installed.

If you want to check out some features about Smart Parking components, please go ahead and take a look! :)
The goal is to provide some "ingredients" for you to build your own prototype or make your own study about Smart Parking!

Great coding, everyone!

P.S: The 'node_modules', 'plugins' and 'platforms' folders are not included. Please be aware that you need to create your own Ionic project first and then you can include the source code in the right place!
